# mern-starter-template

### Steps to setup and run:
1. Clone the project.
2. The mern project is seperated into two parts i.e. the frontend (react) and backend (express).
3. Open up the directory in terminal or powershell.
4. Change the individual project name in the package.jsons if you want.
5. Run npm install or yarn install in both the directories (frontend and backend).
6. Run the frontend using npm start, it will run in localhost:3000.
7. Run the backend using npm server or preferably install nodemon globally ```npm install -g nodemon``` and run nodemon server.
8. That's pretty much it.

### Future plans:
- [ ] Make the process a bit seamless by adding a setup [dot] sh.
